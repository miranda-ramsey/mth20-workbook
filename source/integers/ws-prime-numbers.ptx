				<title>The Sieve of Eratosthenes</title>
				<introduction>
					<p>
						Eratosthenes was an ancient greek mathematician who developed a technique for identifying primes using the following steps:
						<ol>
							<li>Start with a list of whole numbers greater than 1. Circle the lowest one (2). This is the first prime number.</li>
							<li>Since any number divisible by 2 is composite, go through the list and cross out every number divisible by 2.</li>
							<li>Find the next prime by circling the smallest number that hasn't been crossed out.</li>
							<li>Cross out every number divisible by that prime number.</li>
							<li>Continue this process, repeating steps c and d for each prime number in your list.</li>
						</ol>
						Perform the Sieve of Eratosthenes to identify each prime number from 2 to 50, and list them out below.

					<p>A <term>factor tree</term> is a visual structure that helps find prime factorizations. Here is an example factor tree for 180.</p>

					<p>This shows that the prime factorization (after collecting and rearranging the prime factors) is <m>2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5</m>, or <m>2^2\cdot3^2\cdot5</m>.</p>
					<p>Create a factor tree for each number by turning each number into two "branches" that are factors of that number, until all branches end with prime factors.</p>
