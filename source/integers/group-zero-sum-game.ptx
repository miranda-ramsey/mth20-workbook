				<li>Aces are worth 1 point, and face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are worth 10 points.</li>
				<li>Black suits (Spades, Clubs) are worth positive points. Red suits (Hearts, Diamonds) are worth negative points.</li>

		<title>How To Play</title>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Choose one player to be the dealer. The dealer shuffles the deck and deals 3 cards to each player.</li>
				<li>Play starts with the player to the dealer's left. The table score starts at 0.</li>
				<li>On your turn, choose a card from your hand and play it onto the discard pile. Add its point value to the table score, and say the new table score out loud.</li>
				<li>If the table score is 0, you win the pile! Collect the discard pile and set it aside, then play another card from your hand to start a new discard pile.</li>
				<li>Draw cards to bring your hand back up to 3 cards, or until the deck is empty.</li>
				<li>Play continues to the left (clockwise) until all cards have been played. If a player has no cards in hand on their turn, their turn is skipped.</li>
				<li>Count up how many cards you've won. Whoever won the most cards wins the round!</li>
