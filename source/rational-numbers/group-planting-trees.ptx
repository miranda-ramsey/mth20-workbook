	<introduction>
		<p>
                The City of Portland has a <url xml:id="tree-instructions" href="https://www.portland.gov/trees/tree-planting-steps">guide for planting trees</url> that includes steps for digging, placing, mulching, and staking the tree.
                When mulching a tree, follow the "3-3-3" rule: add mulch to a depth of 3 inches, starting 3 inches away from the tree trunk, out to 3 feet away from the tree trunk.
