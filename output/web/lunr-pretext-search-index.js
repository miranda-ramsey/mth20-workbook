  "body": " Group Activity: Zero Sum   You will need a deck of playing cards with the jokers and any marketing cards removed and set aside.  Aces are worth 1 point, and face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are worth 10 points.  Black suits (Spades, Clubs) are worth positive points. Red suits (Hearts, Diamonds) are worth negative points.      How To Play    Choose one player to be the dealer. The dealer shuffles the deck and deals 3 cards to each player.  Play starts with the player to the dealer's left. The table score starts at 0.  On your turn, choose a card from your hand and play it onto the discard pile. Add its point value to the table score, and say the new table score out loud.  If the table score is 0, you win the pile! Collect the discard pile and set it aside, then play another card from your hand to start a new discard pile.  Draw cards to bring your hand back up to 3 cards, or until the deck is empty.  Play continues to the left (clockwise) until all cards have been played. If a player has no cards in hand on their turn, their turn is skipped.  Count up how many cards you've won. Whoever won the most cards wins the round!     "
