  "body": " Group Activity: Zero Sum   You will need a deck of playing cards with the jokers and any marketing cards removed and set aside.  Aces are worth 1 point, and face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are worth 10 points.  Black suits (Spades, Clubs) are worth positive points. Red suits (Hearts, Diamonds) are worth negative points.      How To Play    Choose one player to be the dealer. The dealer shuffles the deck and deals 3 cards to each player.  Play starts with the player to the dealer's left. The table score starts at 0.  On your turn, choose a card from your hand and play it onto the discard pile. Add its point value to the table score, and say the new table score out loud.  If the table score is 0, you win the pile! Collect the discard pile and set it aside, then play another card from your hand to start a new discard pile.  Draw cards to bring your hand back up to 3 cards, or until the deck is empty.  Play continues to the left (clockwise) until all cards have been played. If a player has no cards in hand on their turn, their turn is skipped.  Count up how many cards you've won. Whoever won the most cards wins the round!     "

Starting at 1, each player says the next number in turn.  The catch is, you cannot say numbers that are divisible by 3 or 5.  If a number is divisible by 3, you must say \"Fizz\" instead.  If a number is divisible by 5, you must say \"Buzz\" instead.  If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you must say \"FizzBuzz\" instead.  If a player makes a mistake, the team starts over at 1!  You can play again with a different pair of numbers instead of 3 and 5. Smaller numbers work best!  For a slightly harder version, you can add a third number that is not allowed, and say \"Toes\" instead. This means some numbers have to be \"FizzToes\", some \"BuzzToes\", and some \"FizzBuzzToes!\"   "

Practice writing whole numbers as their prime factorization.     The Sieve of Eratosthenes  Eratosthenes was an ancient greek mathematician who developed a technique for identifying primes using the following steps:  Start with a list of whole numbers greater than 1. Circle the lowest one (2). This is the first prime number.  Since any number divisible by 2 is composite, go through the list and cross out every number divisible by 2.  Find the next prime by circling the smallest number that hasn't been crossed out.  Cross out every number divisible by that prime number.  Continue this process, repeating steps c and d for each prime number in your list.  Perform the Sieve of Eratosthenes to identify each prime number from 2 to 50, and list them out below.               2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10    11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20    21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30    31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40    41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50     True or False  All odd numbers are prime.  All even numbers are composite.      Factor Trees   A factor tree is a visual structure that helps find prime factorizations. Here is an example factor tree for 180.     This shows that the prime factorization (after collecting and rearranging the prime factors) is , or .  Create a factor tree for each number by turning each number into two \"branches\" that are factors of that number, until all branches end with prime factors.   24  56  49  81      Greatest Common Factors   The Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of a group of two or more numbers is the greatest factor that is shared between all of the numbers. For instance, the greatest common factor of 10 and 15 is 5.  Find the greatest common factor for the following groups.   6, 9  8, 12, 18  16, 17  10, 20, 30   Self Reflection On a scale of 1-5, how confident are you with the material in this worksheet?
